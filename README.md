# What is this?

Thie is a simple SvelteKit example of deferred transitions.

The original work was provided at:  https://svelte.dev/examples#deferred-transitions 
This didn't come from me - it is very impressive work.  Info added to repo for 
testing of modal popup in a dashboard page.  The whole "key" technique is 
pretty powerful.

This program originated as a skeleton only Sveltekit build.
